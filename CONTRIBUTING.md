## Commit Message Guidelines

We have very precise rules over how our Git commit messages must be formatted. This leads to **more readable messages** that are easy to follow when looking through the **project history**.

### Types of Commit Messages:

- **`build:`** Changes that affect the build system or external dependencies (example scopes: npm, webpack)
- **`chore:`** Other changes that don't modify `src` or `test` files
- **`ci:`** Changes to our CI configuration files and scripts (example scopes: Travis, Circle, BrowserStack, SauceLabs)
- **`docs:`** Documentation-only changes (like updating the README or API docs)
- **`feat:`** A new feature
- **`fix:`** A bug fix
- **`perf:`** A code change that improves performance
- **`refactor:`** A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
- **`revert:`** Reverts a previous commit
- **`style:`** Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (white-space, formatting, missing semi-colons, etc)
- **`test:`** Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests

### Commit Message Example:

bashCopy code

`feat: Add user login capability`

## Pull Request Process

1. Ensure any install or build dependencies are removed before the end of the layer when doing a build.
2. Update the README.md with details of changes to the interface, this includes new environment variables, exposed ports, useful file locations, and container parameters.
3. Increase the version numbers in any examples files and the README.md to the new version that this Pull Request would represent. The versioning scheme we use is [SemVer](http://semver.org/).
4. You may merge the Pull Request in once you have the sign-off of two other developers, or if you do not have permission to do that, you may request the second reviewer to merge it for you.
