# React Native UI

## How To Install Native

```bash
npm i @emotion/native @emotion/react @lextdev/lext
```

## Font Load

To use custom fonts in your project, create a `react-native.config.js` file in the root directory of your project. Add the fonts to the relevant section, and the font extensions should be in `.ttf` format.

```js
module.exports = {
  assets: ["./assets/fonts"],
}
```
